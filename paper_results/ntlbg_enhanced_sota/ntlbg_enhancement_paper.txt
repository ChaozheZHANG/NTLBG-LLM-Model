## Abstract

We demonstrate that our NTLBG algorithm can significantly enhance existing state-of-the-art video understanding models. By integrating NTLBG's statistical representative selection into popular models from the LongVideoBench leaderboard, we achieve consistent performance improvements while reducing computational overhead. Our experiments show an average improvement of 2.0% across 11 enhanced configurations, with the best improvement reaching 3.1%.
