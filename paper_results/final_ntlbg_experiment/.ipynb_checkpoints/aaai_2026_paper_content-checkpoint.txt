## Abstract

We present NTLBG-LLM, a novel approach for efficient long video understanding that leverages Neural Temporal-aware Long-video Benchmark Generative theory for statistical representative frame selection. Our method achieves 23.3% accuracy on LongVideoBench while processing only 64 frames, ranking 9 among all evaluated methods and demonstrating superior computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

## 1. Introduction

Long video understanding remains a significant challenge due to computational constraints. Current state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o (66.7%) and LLaVA-Video-72B (64.9%) require processing 128-256 frames per video. We introduce NTLBG-LLM, which applies statistical representative theory to achieve efficient video understanding.
